Generation of Quadruples for the expressions generated by the grammar


E→E+T +T

T→T*F | F

F→( E ) |VAR

+ Description
The quadruples are intermediate code forms of expressions having the following form

Operator Operand1 Operand2 Result

One can store the quadruples in a structure as follows:

struct quad

{

char op[5];

char arg1[10];

char arg2[10];

char result[10];

}

The following program generates the quadruples for the expressions that are generated by
the grammar given above. The quadruple is generated only for the productions involving
operators such as E→E+T and T→ T*F. While generating the quadruples, the result will
be stored in the operator1 for further use.
